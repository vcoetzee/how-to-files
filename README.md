# how-to-files

There are many ways to accomplish most tasks in Data science. Students are often overwhelmed by the various options. Here I provide detailed, step-by-step solutions for some of the common tasks, aimed at beginners using Microsoft Windows. They are by no means the only options. 

I also included some of my own conventions in this guide. These conventions are not compulsory. 

These guides include instructions for mySQL and Python. MySQL was voted the most popular database (https://learnsql.com/blog/most-popular-databases-2023/), and Python the most popular data science programming language in 2023 (https://www.datacamp.com/blog/top-programming-languages-for-data-scientists-in-2022).

## The most important how-to-guides include:

1. how-to-load-data-into-mysql (detailing how to load data from .csv and .txt files into a mySQL database)

## Other optional how-to-guides include:
1. MySQL-connector-python (useful if you want to conduct sql queries on your mySQL database using a python script)
